Lab policies to open science

**Stage 1: Prior to data collection**

These steps should be completed prior to data collection, excluding pilot tests, manipulation tests or other pre-tests that will not necessarily be included in the project.

1. **IRB.** Make sure that IRB is approved and up to date.
2. **OSF Project**. Open a project at OSF.

1. IRB: In the project wiki, type the number and expiration date of the project&#39; IRB.
2. Component Structure: Create relevant components to the project ([for more information read here](http://help.osf.io/m/projects/tags?tag=Component)):

- _Larger files (grants with multiple projects):_ If it&#39;s a series of projects nested within a large superordinate project, each project should have its own component, and each component should be associated with the appropriate collaborators.
- _Smaller projects (multiple studies):_ If it&#39;s a series of studies nested within each project, each study should have its own component.

1. Pre-Registration: Upload pre-registration document to OSF

- Pre-registration is required for each study that is run in the lab. But specification should differ based on study. See guidance in pre-registration models.

1. **Data Storage.** Make arrangements on how/where to store data.

1. Data structure **:** plan data structure that will allow you to keep track of studies.

- _Larger files :_ Create empty folders in the designated hbs server location. Follow these guidelines for the folder structure.
- _Smaller files:_ If you are planning to save files on your own computer, these would later be uploaded to OSF. If you are planning to save files on the server (usually for larger folders):

1. Github **.** If you are have a github code that is associated with the project (for a task, data scraping and processing):

- _If your github repository is directly related to your project_: connect the github repository as a component ([see instructions](http://help.osf.io/m/addons/l/837075-connect-github-to-a-project)).
- _If github repository is less central but still related:_ Add the github reference to the project wiki.

**Stage 2: Prior to paper submission**

These steps should be taken before any paper submission occurring in the lab.

1. **OSF Project**. Make sure that your OSF project is updated and public, follow these instruction:

1. Collaborators: Make sure that James is added as a collaborator to the project. Include all other collaborators to the relevant structures.
2. IRB: IRB number should appear in the project wiki.
3. Pre-Registration: Make sure that pre-registrations are public. Each component should have its own pre-registrations.

1. **Data Storage.** Finalize data upload and indexing before paper submission:

1. Data Structure: Make sure that your data structure will allow other people to find the files they need

- _Larger files:_ If you are planning to save files on the server, make sure to follow these instructions.
- _Smaller files:_Upload your files to OSF, make sure that files are uploaded properly in accordance to the instructions in the prior section (Stage 1, 2b), using a different component for each study.

1. Files Road Map: Upload a road map of the location of the file and the person responsible. Road map should be a word or text file that provides a detailed explanation of the folder structure for the project. File road map should be located:

- _If using server:_ In your OSF wiki and in the main folder of the server.
- _If not using server for data storage:_ in OSF wiki

1. Github **.** If you are have a github code that is associated with the project (for a task, data scraping and processing):

- _If your github repository is directly related to your project_: connect the github repository as a component ([see instructions](http://help.osf.io/m/addons/l/837075-connect-github-to-a-project)).
- _If github repository is less central but still related:_ Add the github reference to the project wiki.

1. **Confirmation Email to James:** Before the paper is finally submitted send James an email with:

1. A link for the OSF project.
2. Files rode map: either mention location or send the actual file.
3. A file of the final version of the paper.
